##Commands
All commands must be prefixed with git. Use **git help &lt;command&gt;** to print the help page for a given command. This will likely give you way more information than you would ever need, but can be very useful. 


|Command          | Function|
|-----------------|---------|
|init             |Initialize a new repo|
|clone            |Copy a repo into a new directory|
|status			  |Get the list of changed files in the repo|
|add 			  |Add file contents to the index (staging)|
|commit 		  |Record changes to the repository|
|push             |Update remote refs along with associated objects|
|pull             |Fetch from and merge with another repository or a local branch|
|checkout         |Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree **IMHO: the most useful command in git**|

This list of commands is likely all you will need to get started with git. And they priovide the git workflow we need to keep track of changes to our code.

##Regular Workflow

** Make changes -> Add Changes -> Commit Changes -> Push to origin -> Pull from origin on live **

###Questions about regular git workflow:

1. What is the difference between adding and commiting?
2. How do I undo something if I didn't want to add it?
3. What is origin?

###Tips:
1. **git add -A** will stage all modified, added, and removed files in the repo
2. **git commit -m "Your Message" --author "Your Name &lt;your.email@adpearance.com&gt;"** commit with style, this will let other people know you made the commit, and let you set the commit message in line.

Sometimes we have multiple things going on, in a given domain at once. A designer might be making changes to the homepage while a dev is working on a different section of the site. Here are some more commands that will let us stay organized, and confient about the status of our project.

##Additional Commands 

|Command          | Function|
|-----------------|---------|
|config			  |Get and set repository or global options|
|remote           |Manage set of tracked repositories|
|branch           |List, create, or delete branches|
|fetch            |Download objects and refs from another repository|
|merge            |Join two or more development histories together|

##Branching Workflow
** Make a branch -> Start Developing -> Add/Commit Changes -> Merge back into master when done **

###Questions about the branching workflow:
1. Log into server, and I'm on a branch?
2. How do I know what feature a branch is working on?
3. What are some of the problems with branching? merge conflicts, only one can be checked out

###Tips:
1. **git checkout -b feature_x** create a new branch named feature_x and check it out
2. **git push origin &lt;branch&gt;** push this branch to origin
3. **git diff &lt;source_branch&gt; &lt;target_branch&gt;**
3. **git checkout feature_x public_html/lib** [Checking out the changes from a branch while on master](http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2009/02/25/git-tip-how-to-merge-specific-files-from-another-branch/). AKA why checkout is the best command.
