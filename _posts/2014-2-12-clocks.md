The other day [**Quinn**](http://qrohlf.com) asked "What would you do if you had the time to do it?" I responded "I want to build a clock." Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it would be an interesting project. Nobody can deny that a clock or watchmaker is passionate about what he does.. I think I am going to pick up an old one off of craigslist and try to fix it.

This is also the first post on this site! I want to thank Quinn for inspiring me to drop linkedin for this, in addition to answering a few questions along the way. I would love to hear any feedback about this website, so please <a href="mailto: bdwhthd@gmail.com"> <strong>email</strong></a>, Let me know what you think! Also, Let me know if you are interested in [**creating**](/create.html) your own website. I would love to help!
