The other day [**Quinn**](https://qrolhf.com) asked "What would you do if you had the time to do it?" I responded "I want to build a clock." Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it would be an interesting project. Also, there is something about clockmaking that seems really interesting. I think I am going to pick up an old one off of craigslist and try to fix it.

I prefer to wake up to [**KMHD**](http://kmhd.org). There is somthing about waking up to jazz, but recently my clock radio has stopped picking up the signal :| ... I suppose that I will be trying to fix it soon, as I would prefer not to replace it.

This is also the first post on this site! I want to thank Quinn for inspiring me to drop linkedin for this, in addition to answering a few questions along the way. I would love to hear any feedback about this website, so please [**email**](bdwhthd@gmail.com), chat, call, text, etc. Let me know what you think! Also, Let me know if you are interested in [**creating**](/create.html) your own online presence. I would love to help!
