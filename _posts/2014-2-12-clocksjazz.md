The other day I was asked. "What would I do if I had the time to do it?" To which I responded "I want to build a clock." Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it would be an interesting project. I also want this clock to have some alarm functionality. I prefer to wake up to [**KMHD**](http://kmhd.org), but recently my clock radio has stopped picking up the signal. Also, there is something about clockmaking that seems really interesting. I think I am going to pick up an old one off of craigslist and try to fix it. I could throw the raspeberry pi in, and give it some speakers.

Also, The website is almost complete! The only section left is fun, work before play..
