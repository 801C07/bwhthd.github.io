Yesterday I had my first software development interview. It didn't go as well as I hoped. I feel like I did fine on the culture aspect of the interview, but when the dreaded programming challenge came along I went into shock. I didn't realize just how disfunctional my brain could be for 40 minutes. However, it became immediately apperant that I was bombing it.

I was asked to write a program that could determine the hand delt to a player in a poker game. I knew the rules of poker, but I couldn't focus on the problem. I couldn't focus on breaking the big problem into smaller ones, at least until it was too late. Anyways, I think it was a great experience. I have never had to code under that kind of pressure, with such high stakes, but next time I think I will be more comfortable.

It was bugging me that I didn't finish the problem during the interview, so I continued working on it. Now it is done and sitting on [**github**](http://github.com/bwhthd/poker-). Obviously, my summer job search continues :)
