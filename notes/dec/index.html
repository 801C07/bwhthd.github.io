### Pape Forms Routing ticket. 

Did not get a clear description of what was needed from PMs before starting, I sent what they asked for, and was then called into a meeting with the client after two rounds of back and forth. Finally got a good description from the client during the call.

###Feedback:

A lot of my main feedback points were addressed during my review. I think you've put together a really good team in terms of culture and skill. Each of these guys are willing to learn new things, and want to do things the right way. Which says a lot. Getting everybody to play well with other teams is a challenge, but I think we do a really good job.

I didn't get a lot of time to work with you personally, which is too bad, but I never had issues operating in code you wrote. And was impressed with how quickly you handled tasks I couldn't get to. (when you helped on maintenance). I really appreciate the opportunity you've given me, and apologize for the lack of notice in my departure. New opportunity is good for me because it puts me between two groups of people as a liason, which I think will be an interesting problem. And very different from what I have done this far during my career.
