###Outdoors
I love being in the outdoors with my friends. I enjoy skiing, backpacking, rock climbing, rafting, etc. In Idaho, this was something that I took for granted. Being in college, I have a lot fewer opportunities to get outside.


###Ultimate
I started playing frisbee in junior high. I had a biology techer that really loved the sport, and occasionally we would leave class to play a game. That is when I started loving the sport. My high school had a team, and I played on it each year. Now I play for Bacchus (Lewis & Clark). This is the first year I have played competative collegiate ultimate.

###Gaming

I am a PC gamer. I was introduced to PC gaming with the original Starcraft and Diablo. I loved those games when I was young. Now I play StarCraft 2, DOTA 2 and a variety of indie games. Here is my [**Steam**](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Benw5858/games?tab=all) account.
