###Outdoors
I have been skiing since I was 3 years old. In Idaho this is a very common occurance. All of my friends from Boise ski. People say there is nothing to do in Idaho, but we get the outdoors. Something that is truly unique about Idaho, that I really undervalued, was the ability to get away... I get outdoors in Oregon, but it is simply not the same.


###Ultimate
I started playing frisbee in junior high. I had a biology techer that really loved the sport, and occasionally we would go outside during class to play a game. That is when I started loving the sport. My high school had a team, and I played on it each year. Now I play for Bacchus (Lewis & Clark). This is the first year I have played competative collegiate ultimate.

###Gaming

I am a PC gamer. I was introduced to PC gaming with the original Starcraft and Diablo. I loved those games when I was young. Now I play StarCraft 2 and DOTA 2.
