##[Spoke.Coffee](http://spoke.coffee) [**@PDXSW**](http://twitter.com/pdxsw).
This was my team for [portland startup weekend](http://portland.startupweekend.org/) 2014. We built a sinatra web application in 8 hours, and took home the award in best customer validation. It was a great [learning experience](/blog/Spoke/)!

##Summer Research 2013
Over the past summer, I worked with professor Jens Mache and a team of Lewis & Clark Students. Our topic of research was parallel computing. We ended up learning a lot about functional programming in the process.

* Haskell Parallelism [**Module**](/haskell.pdf), this was published in [**WORLDCOMP**](http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/).

* Boids Simulation [**Paper**](/boids.pdf), an attempt at using [**Rivertrail**](https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail) to parallelize the flocking simulation.

* CUDA DNA sequencing algorithm [**Poster**](\cuda.pdf), our results for using [**prefix summation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) techniques for computing the [**Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Algorithm**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm).

* The [**website**](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/parallel/) Dani Fenske created to keep record of our project.
