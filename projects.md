##Summer Research 2013
Over the past summer, I worked with professor Jens Mache and a team of Lewis & Clark Students. Our topic of research was parallel computing. We ended up learning a lot about functional programming in the process.

* Haskell Parallelism [**Module**](/haskell.pdf), this was published in [**WORLDCOMP**](http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/).
* Boids Simulation [**Paper**](/boids.pdf), an attempt at using [**Rivertrail**](https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail) to parallelize the flocking simulation.
* CUDA DNA sequencing algorithm [**Poster**](\cuda.pdf), our results for using [**prefix summation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) techniques for computing the [**Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Algorithm**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm).
* The [**website**]() Dani Fenske created to keep record of our project.
