##[InstructionsNow.com](http://instructionsnow.com)

June - August 2014.
This is a website I built for [**The Hoffman Group**](http://thehoffmangroup.com). They are a local automotive parts manufacturer. They needed a website to host all of the instructions for their parts, so their customers can find up-to-date installation instructions. I wrote all of the code for this site. However, I did not have a lot of input in the styling, but it works really well on mobile!

May 2-4, 2014. Tatoosh School is a great organization that does outdoor learning in Southeast Alaska. I helped them update their site to a new WordPress [**theme**](http://themeforest.net/item/charitas-foundation-wordpress-theme/5150694). This involved lots of content migration and a small amount of changing the underlying CSS and PHP. It was great working with Peter and Erin!

This was my team for [**portland startup weekend**](http://portland.startupweekend.org/) April 25-27, 2014. We built a sinatra web application in 8 hours, and took home the award in best customer validation. It was a great [**learning experience**](/blog/Spoke/)!

##Summer Research 2013
Over the past summer, I worked with professor Jens Mache and a team of Lewis & Clark Students. Our topic of research was parallel computing. We ended up learning a lot about functional programming in the process.

* Haskell Parallelism [**Module**](/haskell.pdf), this was published in [**WORLDCOMP**](http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/).

* Boids Simulation [**Paper**](/boids.pdf), an attempt at using [**Rivertrail**](https://github.com/RiverTrail/RiverTrail) to parallelize the flocking simulation.

* CUDA DNA sequencing algorithm [**Poster**](\cuda.pdf), our results for using [**prefix summation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) techniques for computing the [**Needlemanâ€“Wunsch Algorithm**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm).

* The [**website**](https://sites.google.com/a/lclark.edu/parallel/) Dani Fenske created to keep record of our project.
