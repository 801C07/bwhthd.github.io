title: Clocks & Jazz

The other day I was asked. "What would I do if I had the time to do it?" To which I responded "I want to build a clock." Not for any particular reason. I just felt like it would be an interesting project. I also want this clock to have some alarm functionality. I prefer to wake up to [**KMHD**](http://kmhd.org), but recently my clock radio has stopped picking up the signal. 

I think it is time to put the raspberry pie to use!
