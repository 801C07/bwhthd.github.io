##Hi! My name is Ben Whitehead, I study mathematics at Lewis & Clark College.


I am interested in anything related to math and the outdoors, this mostly results in programming, web development, skiing, backpacking, and playing frisbee. I am very passionate about the Northwest culture and lifestyle. I am from Boise, Idaho. Now I live and attend school in Portland, Oregon.
