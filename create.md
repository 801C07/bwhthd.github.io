We can meet in person, talk about your goals. I will then create your website, based off of information from our conversation and your resume. We will meet again to unvail your new website, and I will teach you the basics of Github, HTML, CSS, and Markdown. Once you understand these concepts, you will be able to learn new development techniques and create whatever you want.
